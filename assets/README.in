Introduction
============

The "Programming with Big Data in R" project (pbdR) is a set of R packages for
HPC. These include highly scalable packages for distributed computing and
statistics, advanced profiling tools, 

You can contact the core team at our google group RBigDataProgramming
(preferred) or alternatively email us at RBigData AT gmail.

For a list of authors and contributors, see the AUTHORS file. For a list of
package versions comprising this release as well as changes over previous
releases, see the RELEASE file.



Installation
============

We provide docker builds hosted on Docker Hub https://hub.docker.com/u/rbigdata/

To build from source, you will need to satisfy the following prerequisites:

* R >= 3.3.0. The 'remotes' package should be installed 
  https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/remotes/index.html
* An installation of MPI for the MPI packages (which includes some of the
  profiling and I/O packages as well). We recommend OpenMPI for Linux and Mac,
  and MS MPI for Windows.
* An installation of PAPI (with static lib built with -fPIC) if installing the
  profiling packages.
* An installation NetCDF4, and a build of ADIOS (with static lib built with
  -fPIC) if installing the I/O packages.

The packages are split into 4 groups: MPI (including distributed linear algebra
and statistics packages), COMM for the various client/server infrastructure,
PROF for the profilers, and IO for the I/O tools. This division of packages is
not as fine-grained as one could possibly select, but it should be good enough
for the vast majority.

The complexities of having to pass library paths and various build flags to the
packages is managed in the 'builder/ENV_VARS' file (which is just an R script).
Many packages (on most platforms) will install without having to modify this
file.

For more information see https://rbigdata.github.io/packages.html. For
troubleshooting, see the problem package's vignette.



Licenses and Copying
====================

pbdR packages are released under a variety of open source licenses.  Generally
we try remain at least somewhat permissive, but some pbdR packages are derived
from other less permissively licensed packages.

The individual packages are licensed under the following licenses:

BSD 2-Clause:
  hpcvis
  kazaam
  pbdCS
  pbdML
  pbdPROF
  remoter
  tasktools

BSD 3-Clause:
  pbdPAPI

GPL >= 2:
  pbdDMAT
  pmclust

GPL 3:
  pbdNCDF4
  pbdZMQ

MPL 2.0:
  pbdADIOS
  pbdBASE
  pbdDEMO
  pbdMPI
  pbdRPC
  pbdSLAP

Copies of each of these license can be found in the 'licenses/' subtree.

Additionally, we use several other packages themselves subject to a variety of
licenses. If you are using the package builder, it will automatically handle
dependency resolution, installing these automatically. However, these licenses
are available with their respective package source/binary distribution(s) on
CRAN.

Finally, we note that the most common distribution of R is the open source/GNU R
implementation of R, which is licensed GPL >= 2. If you wish to use a different
distribution of R, such as Renjin (http://www.renjin.org/) or TERR
(https://docs.tibco.com/products/tibco-enterprise-runtime-for-r), you are free
to do so. However, all of our testing has been done on open source R, and all
of our binary distributions (e.g. Docker images) ship open source R.

Anything distributed in this build without an explicit statement of copyright
(such as those found in the packages themselves) can be assumed to be BSD
2-Clause. If you need a more explicit statement of copyright for whatever
reason, please feel free to contact us.
