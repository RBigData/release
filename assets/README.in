pbdR Version {VERSION}, {DATE}



Introduction
============

The "Programming with Big Data in R" project (pbdR) is a set of highly scalable
R packages for distributed computing and profiling in data science.

You can contact the core team at our google group RBigDataProgramming
(preferred) or alternatively email us at RBigData AT gmail.

copyrights for various packages distributed here, see the COPYING file. For a

Installation
============

Prerequisites:
* R >= 3.3.0. The 'remotes' package should be installed 
  https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/remotes/index.html
* An installation of MPI for the MPI packages (which includes some of the
  profiling and I/O packages as well). We recommend OpenMPI for Linux and Mac,
  and MS MPI for Windows.
* An installation of PAPI (with static lib built with -fPIC) if installing the
  profiling packages.
* An installation NetCDF4, and a build of ADIOS (with static lib built with
  -fPIC) if installing the I/O packages.

The packages are split into 4 groups: MPI (including distributed linear algebra
and statistics packages), COMM for the various client/server infrastructure,
PROF for the profilers, and IO for the I/O tools. This division of packages is
not as fine-grained as one could possibly select, but it should be good enough
for the vast majority.

The complexities of having to pass library paths and various build flags to the
packages is managed in the 'builder/ENV_VARS' file (which is just an R script).
Many packages (on most platforms) will install without having to modify this
file.
