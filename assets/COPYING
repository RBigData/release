Finally, we distribute the open source/GNU R implementation of R, which is
licensed GPL >= 2. If you wish to use a different distribution of R, such as
Renjin (http://www.renjin.org/) or TERR
(https://docs.tibco.com/products/tibco-enterprise-runtime-for-r), you are free
to do so. However, all of our testing has been done on open source R, and all
of our binary distributions ship open source R.
