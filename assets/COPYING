pbdR packages are released under a variety of licenses.  Generally we try remain
at least somewhat permissive, but some pbdR packages are derived from other
less permissively licensed packages.

The individual packages are licensed under the following licenses:

BSD 2-Clause:
  hpcvis
  kazaam
  pbdCS
  pbdML
  pbdPROF
  remoter

BSD 3-Clause:
  pbdPAPI

GPL >= 2:
  pbdDMAT
  pmclust

GPL 3:
  pbdNCDF4
  pbdZMQ

MPL 2.0:
  pbdADIOS
  pbdBASE
  pbdDEMO
  pbdMPI
  pbdRPC
  pbdSLAP

Copies of each of these license can be found in the 'licenses/' subtree.

Additionally, we use several other packages themselves subject to a variety of
licenses. If you are using the package builder, it will automatically handle
dependency resolution. However, these licenses are available with their
respective package source/binary distribution(s) on CRAN.

Finally, we distribute the open source/GNU R implementation of R, which is
licensed GPL >= 2. If you wish to use a different distribution of R, such as
Renjin (http://www.renjin.org/) or TERR
(https://docs.tibco.com/products/tibco-enterprise-runtime-for-r), you are free
to do so. However, all of our testing has been done on open source R, and all
of our binary distributions ship open source R.

Anything distributed in this build without an explicit statement of copyright
(as can be found in the packages) can be assumed to be BSD 2-Clause. If you
need a more explicit statement of copyright for whatever reason, please feel
free to contact us.
